'''
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be
very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of
odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single
integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns N.
For example:
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11
[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160
